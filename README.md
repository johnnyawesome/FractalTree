# FractalTree

A mouse-controlled fractal Tree written in Processing

##Update
I wrote a better, colored version in P5JS, [you can find it here](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/FractalTreeP5JS)
######## end update ########

Move the mouse to the top-left corner of the window to begin.

Move it to the right to change the angle of the branches.

Move it down to add more branches.

This results in a very simple tree if the mouse is in the top-left corner...

...and in a complex tree if you're in the bottom right corner:
